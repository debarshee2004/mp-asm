; Program to add 7 bytes from memory address 0x9500 and store the result in 0xD000 and carry in 0xD001

MOV SI, 9500 ; Load the address 0x9500 into register SI
MOC CL, 0x07 ; Set the count to 7 for byte-wise operation
MOV BL, 0x00 ; Initialize BL to 0
MOV AL, [SI] (skip) ; Load the byte from memory address 0x9500 into register AL
INC SI ; Increment SI to point to the next byte
ADD AL, [SI] ; Add the byte at the next address to AL
JNC label ; Jump if no carry (if the last operation did not cause a carry)
INC BL ; Increment BL if there was a carry
DEC CL (label)  ; Decrement the count
JNZ skip ; Jump if not zero (if there are more bytes to process)
MOV [0xD000], AL ; Store the result in memory address 0xD000
MOV [0xD001], BL ; Store the carry in memory address 0xD001
INT 3 ; Interrupt 3 - used for debugging or to signal the end of the program
